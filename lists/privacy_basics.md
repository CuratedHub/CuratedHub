# Privacy Basics

## Why care about privacy?
If you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear. [Amarite](https://github.com/CuratedHub/CuratedHub/assets/174886508/389ada3a-2fa4-4b61-addd-3d7adab5991b)? 



## Obfuscation  
Obfuscation is the name of the game. Play dumb to outsmart the smart. Make yourself the decoy. 
Picture this: A crypto wallet with two passwords. The first reveals a modest $7,438 in Monero. 
When thieves come knocking, they think they've obtained your stash (assuming you don't live in something nicer than a McMansion).
They leave happy, you act sad. 
Then when they leave, you log into your other password with $142,000 in crypto and order a pizza.  

You want to blend in, right? Operate like a nesting doll. 
So, for your everyday online activities, you use a static VPN – like a consistent digital disguise for
routine tasks like torrenting (rembember, you aren't dumb, just playing dumb). Do this as 
much as possible, until your government or corporate entities [swallow](https://murdoch.is/papers/ndss16doyousee.pdf) your liberties. 
But when privacy is paramount, you disappear into the crowd. 
A shared VPN, your own VPS, or even the anonymity of Tor become your cloaks, ensuring your sensitive activities remain shrouded from prying eyes.

## Open-source  
Open-source software is not inherently more private or secure than proprietary software. It is in all likelihoods less secure because a corporation
has more to lose and more resources to ensure proper code. But it is about trust. To place trust in something is to awknowledge you are
admitting in risk and uncertainty.[^1]
A trustless system, in which you do not have to put your trust in a third party, is ideal. But it's not practical. It is practically impossible
to make any system completely trustless[^2]. We are social 
creatures, taking part in inherently social activities requiring at least one other party (whether reading a forum post or sending
a message). The complex software we use is built upon even more complex software, built upon libraries, built upon complex hardware, connected through complex protocols.  

We can get something close. Something decentralized with no central authority, and most importantly, verifiable. That's the key. Verifiability. 
Open-source means transparency. The ability to validate the authenticity of what we are working with to ensure it has not been tampered with 
or ill-designed. Confidence in what we are using. Yet we are only placing our trust in another party. Even a very advanced programmer 
is not going to verify that a complex piece of open-source software is doing what it says it will do. It's just not feasible to try to
undertake the task of translating how the code was assembled. So we place our trust in peer-review and third party testing. Of course, 
this itself can be bad operations security.[^3][^4] You naturally believe that because there are more eyes on the code, the level of scrutiny
rises in a linear fashion, when that may not always be the case.[^5] Alternatively, we may have an 
[information cascade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_cascade), in which you, the reader, views this paragraph and because it aligns 
with countless other pro-privacy paragraphs you have read, believe it to be close to infallible.  

With proprietary, closed-source software, we can't peer review or audit the software in depth. When we utilize one of the most trusted 
VPN services, [Mullvad](https://mullvad.net/), we still lack access to their infrastructure, live operations, and live server. 


## Anonymity  
Do not confuse privacy with anonymity. Services like [privacy.com](https://privacy.com/) offer some privacy from the official ledger-keepers
(a.k.a. credit and debit card companies), but not from privacy.com and not from those privacy.com is required to divulge its information to. 
As you may have gleaned from the open-source section above, true anonymity is little more than a fiction once you are online. But you
can get close, as these future guides will show you. And privacy from non-governmental or major corporate entities is much more attainable.
